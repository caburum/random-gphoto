		Your privacy is important to us. It is random-gphoto's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
		may collect from you across our website, random-gphoto. We only ask for personal information when we need it to
		provide services to you. We only collect it through user-initiated actions, with your knowledge and consent.

		When you sign in with your Google account and grant our app access to your photos library, your authentication
		tokens will be stored in secure cookies. These can be removed at any time by pressing "logout".

	<p>
		When logged in, your token is used to display general information including your name and email address, but is not
		collected or stored anywhere.

	<p>
		When you load your Google Photos library by clicking "update media", your non-archived and non-deleted media is
		fetched and cached on your client, only including its unique media ID and your unique Google account ID. No media
		content is permanently stored.
	</p>
	<p>All cached data can be removed by pressing "clear current user cache" in the settings.</p>
	<p>
		When you load a new item, its media is dynamically loaded and displayed, and not persisted anywhere on the client.

		Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal
		information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact
		us.
